# PoseEstimationProject
This is an Image processing example which can later be used in so many applications. The main goal of the project is to learn opencv-python and mediapipes in the most interesting of ways
and to get the hang of how these things work. The goal is to track a certain point in  your body say an elbow( 14th index acccording to the pose folder in mediapipe). 
The project also highlights the difference between detection and tracking. There are three files in this project.
<li>The **PoseEstimationMin** which is the minimum posssible code needed to getting our goal achieved
<li>The *PoseEstimationModule* file which executes the class format of the previous file so as to be accessed later by some other application
<li>The **OurCoolPosingApp** is the application/game which can access the module so as to perform the pose estimation
